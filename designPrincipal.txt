1.  Usage Proposal:
      ib.checkAPIconnection
      ib.reqCurrTime
      ib.reqAcctName
      
2.  Upon connection to API, server will send message back to client (date and time).  
    Use this to check API connection is successful.
    
3.  If IB date is equal to client date (local system), submit request for data.  
    Determine if end-of-message (EOM) code is received.
    EOM will vary depending on the data submitted to the server.
    Close the connection once EOM is received.
    
4.  Avoid creating multiple clients to each server.  Whenever possible, connect only 1 client
    to each server.  
    
5.  Do not keep client connection open for extended time.  Close the connection once data
    request is completed.
  
6.  First submission to TWS-Server is to tell which version of the client (default is 62).
